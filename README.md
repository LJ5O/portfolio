## About it

You can visit my portfilio here : https://that-it-guy.dev/. This project isn't really phone-compatible for now, but I'm planning to add phone-compatibility.

I made it with **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)**, and used **Blender** to create 3D models and animations.

That's still a *work in progress*. For now, the code is written in English, and the website is French. I'll add more languages soon.

I'll try to keep this up to date, and to enhance the project from time to time.

## TODO list

- [x] Setup the Three.js scene
- [x] Camera placement and player movement
- [x] Create some gltf models and apply textures/colours on them
- [x] Add some facts about me on signs
- [ ] Add a loading screen
- [ ] Add a menu, so users can chose a language, ect..
- [ ] Add a phone version
- [ ] Add English and Japanese versions
- [ ] Create a simple website with everything on it, so people who don't like walking from signs to signs can find quickly information
- [ ] Find something to add on this list
